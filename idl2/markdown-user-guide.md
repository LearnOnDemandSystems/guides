# Markdown User Guide

Markdown is an easy to use markup language that offers multiple ways to achieve the same result. Markdown was designed to be easy to learn as well as be easy to read and write. Markdown allows the author to keep their hands on the keyboard and focus on writing content. Markdown supports HTML, and HTML syntax can be used in combination with Markdown.

### Headings
Markdown allows for text to be resized by typing 1-6 # symbols in front of the text that is to be resized. One # renders the largest text size, while six # symbols renders the smallest text size.Typically this is used at the beginning of a paragraph or section in a document.

### Text Formatting

- **Bold**: used to show emphasis. Type two * (asterisk) symbols on each side of the text that is to be bolded.
- **_Italic_**: used to show emphasis or distinction. Type two _ (underline) on each side of text that is to be emphasized.
- **~~Strikethrough~~**: used to mark text that should not be included, but should not be removed from the document. Type two ~ (tilde) symbols on each side of text that should show a strikethrough.
- **Escape character**: used to prevent text from being formatted into Markdown. Type a \ (backslash) at the beginning of the text that is to be escaped. 
- **Indent size**: pressing the tab key will indent 4 spaces.
- **Inline code block**: used to provide a snippet of code that can be copied and pasted. Type a ` (backtick) on each side of the text that is to be displayed in the code block. 
- **Fenced code block**: used to provide a programming language-specific code snippet. Type three ` (backticks) on each side of the text that should be displayed in the fenced code block. This should consume at least 3 lines in the text editor; the first line should display three backticks followed by the programming language name, the second line should display the code snippet, and the last line should only display three backticks. Markdown allows for more than one line to be used to display the code snippet.
