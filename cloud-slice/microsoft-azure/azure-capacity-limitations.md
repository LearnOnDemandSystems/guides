## **Azure Capacity Limitations**

Azure has capacity limitations that should be considered in advance, to avoid running into limitations during the use of the Cloud Slice lab.After the class or event is scheduled, it is a good idea to start projecting the amount of resources that will be needed during the class based on the number of lab users and the amount of resources that each lab user will need.

A support request must be made to Microsoft to adjust the amount of resources that are available to use in the Azure subscription. Depending on the resources requested, the region requested and severity of the request, it may take an extended amount of time for the support request to be fulfilled by Microsoft.
